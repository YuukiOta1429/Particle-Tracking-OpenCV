# Particle-Tracking
> This project is inspired by a lecture (Brownian-motion-exp.) in school. The main goal of this project is to extend self-learning programing skill and provide more convenient tools to optimized the postprocessing. Looking forward to share to junior students! 

## To-do list
- [ ] Part 1 Develop functions 
  - [x] Read several types of images (tif, jpg, png)
  - [x] Convert sequences of images into animation -> expoort
  - [x] Relation beetween sequentail of images -> cross correlation
  - [ ] Coefficient of viscosity
  - [ ] Graph the in XY cororidnated system
  
- [ ] Part 2 Organized and record the process
  - [ ] Github -> *Create this repository!* 
  - [ ] TA (teaching material, demo code, ppt)

## Project Workflow
1. Collect data and necessary environment setting (temp.)
2. Preprocesisng
   - Convert to animation -> find the trend of particles movement
   - Track -> Normal Cross Correlaiton
3. Play around with computer vision tools in "OpenCV"
   - Common filter
   - Color transform
   - Resize, Augmentation
